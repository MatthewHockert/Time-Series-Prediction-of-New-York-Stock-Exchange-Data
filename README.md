# Time-Series-Prediction-of-New-York-Stock-Exchange-Data

Why am I doing this project?

I am creating this project to show that I have a diversified skillset. I have done many of these types of modeling in different languages such as SAS and R and I want to try and apply what I have learned in these languages to a new language. I hope to exhibit both a strong coding ability and an understanding of the math behind the analysis. I am new to python, so I have referenced other code. Data was found on Kaggle. Methods were taught in class.

What were my steps to create this project Graph the data?
1.	Clean and visualize the data
2.	Calculate returns
3.	Test for stationarity: Dickey-Fuller Test
4.	Choosing parameters using ACF and PACF charts
5.	Build ARIMA time-series model
6.	Plot Predictions with Actual
7.	Make Forecast
8.	Analyze results

Future application?
I hope to apply machine learning methods and compare them to what I have learned in class.
